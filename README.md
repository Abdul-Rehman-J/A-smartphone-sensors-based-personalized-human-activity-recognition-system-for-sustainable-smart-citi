Abstract:The fast propagation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has driven to the development of collaborative healthcare frameworks to support the next generation healthcare industry for quality medical healthcare. This paper presents a generalized collaborative framework named collaborative shared healthcare plan (CSHCP) for cognitive health and fitness assessment of people using ambient intelligent application and machine learning techniques. CSHCP provides support for daily physical activity recognition, monitoring, assessment and generate a shared healthcare plan based on collaboration among different stakeholders: doctors, patient guardians, as well as close community circles. The proposed framework shows promising outcomes compared to the existing studies. Furthermore, the proposed framework enhances team communication, coordination, long-term plan management of healthcare information to provide a more efficient and reliable shared healthcare plans to people.
